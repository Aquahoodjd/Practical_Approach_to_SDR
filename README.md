# Practical_Approach_to_SDR
As the title suggests,you get to understand the the concepts of Software Defined Radio and hardware/software that help in wireless system design. After extensive survey it was found that adopting open source software/hardware could be right fit and hence the use of GNU Radio like open software and Ettus USRP open hardware has been used for all experiments. Given this reason, all the grc files present should serve as a good practical guide from basic to intermediate level. GNU Radio is a free &amp; open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.
